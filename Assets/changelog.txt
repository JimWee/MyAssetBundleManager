version 2.08

- Compatibility fixes for Windows Phone 8.1 and WSA8.1. Should work out of the box now.

- Added a benchmark scene.


version 2.07

- lzma plugin: fix for decompression of asset bundles.


version 2.06

- Winx86, Winx86_64 & WSA plugins: full unicode support on paths and filenames. Was problematic before.


version 2.05 (important update)

- progress functions are the same on all platforms now. That introduced a small breaking code change.
  Instead of providing a referenced integer or float you provide a single item integer of float array.
  Removed deprecated iOS functions to get progress.

- iOS: renamed some native functions to avoid collision with unity's libiphone lib.

- lzma: added a function to decompress a compressed Asset Bundle.

- lzma: added an example on how to decompress a compressed asset bundle from the StreamingAssets Folder.

- zip: fixed an issue with decompressing of zip files containing the '__MACOSX' folder.
  The '__MACOSX' folder will be ignored along with files starting with '._' and files with 0 bytes size.



version 2.0 (Major update)

- Added WebGL support for all plugins!

- Linux, iOS, Android, MacOSX can treat now buffers as files. That means if you have a file in www.bytes
  you can perform operations directly on the buffer.
  For Android this is very useful since you can decompress from Streaming Assets without copying to
  Persistent data path.

- all plugins/all platforms: added support for fixed buffer operations to avoid memory allocations.

- lzma: added support for partial buffer compression.

- lzma: added the ability to modify the compression properties for buffers and lzma alone files.

- refactored the preprocessor directives to comply with Unity 5.3.

- iOS: simulator plugins have now universal, i386 and x86_64 variations.



version 1.9.1

- added fastLZ support.


version 1.9

- Added LZ4 support. (Read the dedicated documentation for it.)

- Discontinued Blackberry support.

- Minor improvements for the lzma plugins.

- WSA10: Accidentally in the previous update the largeFiles support for 7z files was removed. Now it is back in.

- added a folder with the plugins separated as unitypackage files.


version 1.8

- iOS: added tvOS, watchOS and simulator plugins.

- Unity5.2: added WSA SDK10 NetCore support. That means even XboxOne is supported.

(Delete the old Metro plugins folder, since it is replaced with a different naming scheme.)



version 1.7.7

- zip: corrected misbehaviour of the compressDir functions on some operating systems.


version 1.7.6

- 7zip iOS: fixed a bug in the get7zInfo function when extracting from the StreamingAssets folder.

- zip iOS : updated the ios plugins to have minimum iOS support 6.0


version 1.7.5

- removed vc++2013 dependency for windows editor.

- zip/7zip iOS: added extra workaround functions to get the progress of files when extracting multiple files in multiple threads. See documentation!


version 1.7.4

- 7zip iOS: added an extra function to get properly the progress of the extracted files.

- 7zip iOS: now you can use the largeFiles flag when decompressing a file that is stored in StreamingAssets to some other folder with writing permissions.

- zip: - added 2 global integers zipFiles & zipFolders that get updated when calling the getFileInfo function.


version 1.7.3

- Fix for the CompressDir function for the zip plugin.

- Total true files in a 7zip file are counted now when calling the get7zInfo function and stored in the trueTotalFiles integer variable.


version 1.7.21

- Hotfix for iOS. Issue was conflicting functions between the zip and 7zip plugin.

version 1.7.1

- cleaned up 7z/lzma cs files.

- added a second method on 7zip decompression for not forcing the user to use a ref int to get the extraction progress when not needed/wanted.


version 1.7

MAJOR UPDATE:

- Added full ZIP support (see appropriate documentation for more).
  In short, compression/decompression of files/directories and buffers is supported on all platforms.

- Changed the way how the decompression progress of archives with multiple files is returned.
  Now you have to provide a referenced integer where the progress will be written to.
  This was done to avoid shared memory violations when having multiple threads calling the same function.

- Progress works now for Linux and Win8.1 (Phone and WSA)

- Removed some obsolete functions and revamped the code.

- Added an example for Android, to copy a file from the StreamingAssets folder to the PersistantDataPath and do there file operations.




version 1.6.2
- critical bug fixed in the 7z decode2Buffer function that caused a crash. Works as expected now.


version 1.6.1
- cleaned up the cs code. Less preprocessor directives used now.

- updated Blackberry plugin. Added x86 binary.


version 1.6

Major update:

-Ability to compress a buffer to the lzma format and to decompress a buffer that is in the lzma format.

-Added basic support for Windows Phone 8.1 and WSA plugins.

-Added a method to get the current number of files extracted from a 7z archive.
 (Provides a solution to get progress of decompression when the 7z archive has multiple files.)

 - Fixed a bug in the Linux plugin where folders where not created correctly.


version 1.5.8
Added ppmd decompression method support.


version 1.5.7
Addressed memory leak issues and changed the get7zInfo and get7zSize functions.
It is recommended to use this verion if you are calling the above functions on 7z archives
that contain hundreds or thousands of files.


version 1.5.5
Added the ability to decode a specific file in a 7z archive to a byte buffer.


version 1.5
Added the ability to get filename and file size information of a 7z archive.
Added the ability to encode/decode to/from .lzma alone format.


version 1.4.5
Added experimental Blackberry support.
Made sure that iOS works on 64bit builds with il2cpp.


version 1.4
Added support for OSX and LINUX.
Now you should be able to test in the editor and use the lib in standalone applications for win,linux,osx.


version 1.3.1
preprocessor fixes


version 1.3
Added support for x86 and x86_64 windows. A macOS version might come in the future.
Removed crc checks on android and ios builds for faster extraction.


version 1.2.5
Added support for x86 Android builds.
Changed the folder structure of the Plugins/Android folder.
Now the plugins for each platform reside in their own folder named after the platform.
You don't have to do anything. Unity will copy the correct lib for you whether you build for arm, x86 or both (fat binary).


version 1.2.1
- By mistake in the previous version the iOS library was the Debug one.
- 3 compiled versions of the library are now included. Debug, Fast and Small, Aggressive optimizations (faster and bigger)
(the variations are included as zip files in the plugins/iOS folder. Unzip the one you want to use)


version 1.2
- Added iOS support
- improved the example and the documentation.
